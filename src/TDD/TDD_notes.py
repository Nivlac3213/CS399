Test Driven Development
"""

"""
Iterative and repeatable process
1) Consider a code module to be written
2) Write the Test First to initially fail
2) Write Minimal code to pass the test_SUSlist_HW
3) Run Code and test_SUSlist_HW functionality

New test_SUSlist_HW per new feature

Doctest v Pytest
Fixtures
Logging

*** Pytest ****
arrange: 
Act: 

*** Fixtures ***
Decorated with @pytest.fixture
This creates something repeatable
fixtures are used if it will be used alot in development

*** "Happy Path" *** 
Happy path is expected values and cases,
edge cases: occures in extreme operating parameters
Corner Case: 

*** Exceptions ***


*** Logging ***
Tracking evens that heppens when the program runs

Debug: Detailed information for diagnosing problems (Too Much info here)
Info: Confirmation that Program is working well
Warning: Indication of something unexpected or indicative of a problem "disk space running low" software still runs normally
Error: software has failed somewhere, not able to perform a function
Critical: Serious Error, program crashed or is unable to continue
